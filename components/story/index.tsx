          I am going to try to be brief and concise and tell you a little about
          me. I am <strong>born and raised in Spain</strong>. My mom is from
          Brazil and my dad is from the town. Because of this, I am bilingual
          and I can speak both <strong>Spanish and Portuguese fluently</strong>.
          I also have been learning english in a private academy for{" "}
          <strong>12 years</strong> and got my
          <strong> C1 certificate</strong>. I have always been a
          <strong> passionate builder</strong>, when I was a small kid I wanted
          to build rockets. Then while I was at elementary school I got
          interested in <strong>robotics</strong> and joined a club. Then I
          started high school and the same year Covid-19 hit. At home and with a
          new laptop I started playing minecraft and joining servers until I
          found many online friends. I started <strong>coding with Java</strong>{" "}
          and discord bots but I quickly moved to coding webpages and different
          things. For 3 years I started projects like one called{" "}

          on a streamer community. After this one I{" "}
          <strong>learned Next.js</strong> and started coding with it. In
          december 2022 I coded a small chatgpt discord bot. On April of 2023
          the bot already was in <strong>100k servers</strong>. Managing a huge
          project was hard and I learned a lot of things from it. We merged this
          bot (

          ) with another one called{" "}
          <a
            href="https://github.com/f1nniboy/ampere"
            target="_blank"

            Ampere
          </a>{" "}
          and we were able to quickly grew to almost{" "}
          <strong>200k servers and â‰ˆ 400k users</strong>. Then since discord.js
          was not working well with the bot, we had to do a migration but the
          new developer from Ampere lied and made us lose money, users and a
          potential seed investment (sorry Finn). I had a OpenAI debt and now
          income since the bot didn&apos;t work and I abandoned the project. At
          this time I started working at{" "}

          (thanks Logan for the opportunity). On <strong>February 2024</strong>{" "}
          I started <strong>working as a developer at Wildfire</strong>. On
          March 2024 I joined{" "}
          <strong>Aditus programme for USA universities</strong>. On May 2024 I
          sold my bot as it kept having users and I was not able to manage it. I
          sold the bot to shapes and they managed to keep growing it (thanks for
          keeping my baby alive). On June 2024 I did my first trip
          &quot;alone&quot; to Madrid with other students from the programme
          Aditus and had one of the best times of my life(thanks guys). I wrote
          my essays, achieved a<strong> SAT score of 1450</strong> at the third
          attempt and now
          <strong> pursuing admission to top US universities</strong>. On
          January 2025 I send all my applications and now I am waiting for
          decisions. <br />
          <br />
          This is my story very briefly, during this last years I travelled, had
          fun, learned, made friends and coded. I am happy for all of this and I
          am looking forward to the future.
